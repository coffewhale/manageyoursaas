   - Repeat for `002_rls_policies.sql` and `003_seed_data.sql`

### Option 2: Using Supabase CLI

If you have the Supabase CLI installed:

```bash
# Initialize Supabase in your project (if not already done)
supabase init

# Link to your remote project

# Apply migrations
supabase db push
```

### Option 3: Manual Execution

SELECT * FROM activity_logs 
WHERE organization_id = 'your-org-id'
